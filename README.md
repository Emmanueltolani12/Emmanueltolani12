## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m a doctoral researcher in Applied Microeconomics at [Technische Universität München (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/) in Germany. I'm interested in applied microeconometrics, data-adaptive methods (aka machine learning) and causal inference. Prior to joining TUM, I obtained my Masters degree in Agricultural and Food Economics at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en). I also worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Institute for Food and Resource Economics (ILR)](https://www.ilr1.uni-bonn.de/en), [Institute for Microeconomics](https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/micro/en), [The Center for Development Research (ZEF)](https://www.zef.de/) & [Universität Koblenz - Landau](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de/impressum.html).
- :dancing_men: I’m looking forward to collaborating on applied microeconometric studies in agriculture and nutrition
- 💬 Reach out to me about R & python for data analytics
- 🤓 Learning about probabilistic geospatial analysis for sustainable agriculture and nutrition security
